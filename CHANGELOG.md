[//]: # (current developments)

## 2.0.0 (2023-09-14)

### Enhancements

* Add support for file extension and URL protocol association on Windows. (#117)
* Add support for URL protocol and file type association in all operating systems. Adds tests and examples. (#118 via #119, #135)
* Add `app_user_model_id` field on Windows shortcuts to group taskbar icons together. (#127 via #133)
* Enable automatic elevation on Unix platforms too, and add tests. (#137 via #138, #139)
* Add recipe and CI workflow steps to build and upload canaries to `conda-canary`. (#144, #145, #149)
* Implement auto-elevation logic in Unix systems so it doesn't depend on pre-existing `.nonadmin` files. (#150 via #156)

### Bug fixes

* Ensure some v1-only import paths are still available for backwards compatibility. (#151)
* Do not capitalize `${DISTRIBUTION_NAME}` in v1-style `menuinst` JSON documents. (#153)

### Docs

* Create Sphinx-based documentation following community practices (constructor, conda-libmamba-solver). Absorbs and updates the existing info in wiki and non-deployed docs. (#112)
* Add development documentation. (#131)

### Other

* Enable and apply pre-commit with isort/flake8/black. (#116, #125)
* Adjust workflows to only target `main` after merging the `cep-devel` branch. (#141)
* Move `cwp.py` from the repository root to `menuinst._legacy` subpackage.
  It's still shipped to `%PREFIX%` in the conda package. (#145)

### 2012-06-12: 2.1.2

  * fixed shortcuts have wrong executable (PR 3)



### 2012-04-25: 2.1.1

 â€¦  in a shortcut definition.  This is then used on win32 only to set
    the 'Start in' directory of the created shortcut.

  * On windows the target length is limited to about 260 chars and we use
    python -m webbrowser instead of running the full path to the module to
    reduce the length of the target.

### 2010-12-09: 2.0.4

  * This version has been used for a long time.


10 October, 2008 (DP):
    - API: Finished refactoring that created the application_menus.py module
        which allows data-driven creation of application menus for both KDE
        and Gnome on RH3, RH4, and probably other modern Linux distributions.
        The RH4 implementation creates application menu files that conform to
        FreeDesktop.org's Desktop Menu Specification 1.0.  Though users may
        need to modify the application_menus.py module to get it to try that
        implementation on another distribution or version.
