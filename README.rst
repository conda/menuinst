This package is was originally developed and maintained by Enthought
under the name AppInst.  The name appinst is a rename of what used
to be called 'wininst'.

Menuinst is currently only supported on Windows.  Legacy code exists for Linux and OS X - use at your own risk.  It may mess up your menus.
