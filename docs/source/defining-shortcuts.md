# Define your own shortcuts

`menuinst` takes JSON configuration files as its input. The minimal structure is a dictionary with
four keys

- `$schema`: The JSON-schema standard version
- `$id`: The version of the menuinst configuration, as a JSON schema URL
- `menu_name`: The name for this group of menu items
- `menu_items`: A list of dictionaries, each defining the settings for one shortcut / menu item.
  Each menu item must define, at least, the following keys (see {class}`MenuItem schema <menuinst._schema.MenuItem>`
  for more details):
    - `name`: The name for this specific shortcut.
    - `command`: A list of strings detailing how to launch the application.
    - `platforms`: A dictionary with up to three keys. All of them are optional but you must at
      least define one. The presence of a key with a non-`null` value enables the shortcut for that
      platform. If you don't include any, shortcuts will not be created. Available keys are:
        - `linux` - see {class}`Linux schema <menuinst._schema.Linux>`
        - `osx`- see {class}`MacOS schema <menuinst._schema.MacOS>`
        - `win`- see {class}`Windows schema <menuinst._schema.Windows>`

```{seealso}
If you want to learn more, check the {doc}`reference` for full details on the available fields and settings for each platform.
The JSON configurations follow a well-defined schema documented at {ref}`schema`.
```

## Minimal example

A minimal example to launch Python's `turtle` module would be:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "https://schemas.conda.io/menuinst-1.schema.json",
  "menu_name": "Python {{ PY_VER }}",
  "menu_items": [
    {
      "name": "Launch Turtle",
      "command": ["python", "-m", "turtle"],
      "platforms": {
        "linux": {},
        "osx": {},
        "win": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```{tip}
Note how the `menu_name` is using a placeholder `{{ PY_VER }}`.
`menuinst` supports Jinja-like variables.
The full list of available placeholders is available at {ref}`placeholders`.
```

This is not using any customization options or advanced features. It's the bare minimum to make it
work: a name, the command, and the target platforms.

## Associate your shortcut with file types and URL protocols

### File types

Each operating system has a slightly different way of associating a file type to a given shortcut.
Unix systems have the notion of MIME types, while Windows relies more on file name extensions.

- On Linux, use the `MimeType` option. Remember to add the `%f` (single file) or `%F` (several
  files) placeholders to your command so the paths are passed adequately. If you are defining a new
  MIME type, you must fill the `glob_patterns` field by mapping the new MIME type to the file
  extensions you want to associate with it.
- On macOS, use `CFBundleDocumentTypes`. Requires no placeholder. The opened document will be
  automatically passed as a regular command-line argument. The file will be dispatched via events.
  You need to define the `event_handler` field to define a logic that will forward the caught files
  to your application (via sockets, API calls, inotify or any other inter-process communication
  mechanism) The association happens via UTI strings (Uniform Type Identifiers). If you need UTIs
  not defined by Apple, use the `UTImportedTypeDeclarations` field if they are provided by other
  apps, or `UTExportedTypeDeclarations` if you are defining them yourself.
- On Windows, use `file_extensions`. Remember to add the `%1` or `%*` placeholders to your command
  so the path of the opened file(s) is passed adequately.

A multi-platform example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "https://schemas.conda.io/menuinst-1.schema.json",
  "menu_name": "File type handler example",
  "menu_items": [
    {
      "name": "My CSV Reader",
      "activate": true,
      "command": ["{{ PREFIX }}/bin/open_menuinst_files.py"],
      "icon": "{{ MENU_DIR }}/open_menuinst_files.{{ ICON_EXT }}",
      "platforms": {
        "linux": {
          "command": ["{{ PREFIX }}/bin/open_menuinst_files.py", "%f"],
          "MimeType": ["application/x-menuinst"],
          "glob_patterns": {
            "application/x-menuinst": ["*.menuinst"]
          }
        },
        "osx": {
          "CFBundleDocumentTypes": [
            {
              "CFBundleTypeName": "org.conda.menuinst.opener",
              "CFBundleTypeRole": "Viewer",
              "LSItemContentTypes": ["org.conda.menuinst.main-file-uti"],
              "LSHandlerRank": "Default"
            }
          ],
          "UTExportedTypeDeclarations": [
            {
              "UTTypeConformsTo": ["public.data", "public.content"],
              "UTTypeIdentifier": "org.conda.menuinst.main-file-uti",
              "UTTypeTagSpecification": [
                {
                  "public.filename-extension": ["menuinst"]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        "windows": {
          "command": ["{{ SCRIPTS_DIR }}/open_menuinst_files.py", "%1"],
          "file_extensions": [".csv"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### URL protocols

Each operating system has a slightly different way of associating a URL protocol to a given
shortcut.

- On Linux, you must use the `MimeType` option too. Use the `x-scheme-handler/your-protocol-here`
  syntax. Remember to add the `%u` (single URL) or `%U` (several URLs) placeholders to your command
  so the URLs are passed adequately.
- On Windows, use `url_protocols`. Remember to add the `%1` or `%*` placeholders to your command so
  the URLs are passed adequately.
- On macOS, use `CFBundleURLTypes`. Requires no placeholders. The URL will be dispatched via
  events. You need to define the `event_handler` field to define a logic that will forward the
  caught URLs to your application (via sockets, API calls, inotify or any other inter-process
  communication mechanism). Note that setting `CFBundleTypeRole` will make the wrapper blip in the
  dock when the URL is opened. If you don't want that, do not set it.
