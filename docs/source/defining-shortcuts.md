# Define your own shortcuts

`menuinst` takes JSON configuration files as its input.
The minimal structure is a dictionary with four keys

- `$schema`: The JSON-schema standard version
- `$id`: The version of the menuinst configuration, as a JSON schema URL
- `menu_name`: The name for this group of menu items
- `menu_items`: A list of dictionaries, each defining the settings for one shortcut / menu item. Each menu item must define, at least, the following keys (see {class}`MenuItem schema <menuinst._schema.MenuItem>` for more details):
    - `name`: The name for this specific shortcut.
    - `command`: A list of strings detailing how to launch the application.
    - `platforms`: A dictionary with up to three keys. All of them are optional but you must at least define one. The presence of a key with a non-`null` value enables the shortcut for that platform. If you don't include any, shortcuts will not be created. Available keys are:
        - `linux` - see {class}`Linux schema <menuinst._schema.Linux>`
        - `osx`- see {class}`MacOS schema <menuinst._schema.MacOS>`
        - `win`- see {class}`Windows schema <menuinst._schema.Windows>`

If you want to learn more, check the {doc}`reference` for full details on the available fields and settings for each platform.
The JSON configurations follow a well-defined schema documented at {ref}`schema`.

## Minimal example 

A minimal example to launch Python's `turtle` module would be:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
    "$id": "https://schemas.conda.io/menuinst-1.schema.json",
    "menu_name": "Python {{ PY_VER }}",
    "menu_items": [
        {
            "name": "Launch Turtle",
            "command": ["python", "-m", "turtle"],
            "platforms": {
                "linux": {},
                "osx": {},
                "win": {},
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

```{tip}
Note how the `menu_name` is using a placeholder `{{ PY_VER }}`.
`menuinst` supports Jinja-like variables. 
The full list of available placeholders is available at {ref}`placeholders`.
```

This is not using any customization options or advanced features.
It's the bare minimum to make it work: a name, the command, and the target platforms.
