# Getting started

`menuinst` can be used to create shortcuts or menu items across operating systems.
It's designed to integrate nicely with `conda` packages, 
but it can be used without it to an extent.

## Installation

`menuinst` is usually installed along with `conda` in the `base` environment.
So, in most cases, you won't have to do much. For other environments, you can do:

```console
$ conda install "menuinst>=2"
```
## Usage

WIP.

Check {doc}`conda` for more information about using `menuinst` from `conda` packages.
