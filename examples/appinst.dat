"""
Example appinst data file, note that this is Python code


Purpose of this file:
=====================

To be able to install an application using all the functionality
that AppInst provides in a single file.  For example you can install
of an application using the code:

   import appinst
   appinst.install_from_dat("ipython.dat")

However you are not required to use this file, you can also call the
various functions AppInst provides yourself.  Just likely having to
write more code yourself.


Variables to define:
====================

At least the variable SHORTCUTS must be defined to declare something
for AppInst to do.

The variable MENUS is optional.  If not provided, AppInst will provide
a default menu structure that corresponds to your application as best
it can.  This defaults turns out pretty well for Python environments
resulting from an Enicab install, but may not do much useful for other
Python environments.
"""


# SHORTCUTS defines the shortcuts to the application(s) in a cross-platform
# way.  That is:
#   * On Windows: The menus end up in the 'Start Menu', quicklaunch icons
#       end up in the QuickLaunch bar, and desktop icons show up on user's
#       desktops.
#   * On OSX: The menus end up in the '/Applications' directory, quicklaunch
#       icons are added to the Dock, and desktop icons show up on the user's
#       desktop.
#   * On Linux: The menus end up in the Gnome or KDE system menus, quicklaunch
#       icons are currently ignored, and desktop icons get added to the user's
#       desktop.
#
# SHORTCUTS is a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per desired shortcut.
# Each shortcut dictionary can have the following keys:
#
# cmd: (required)
#   The command line arguments to start the application the shortcut refers
#   to.
#
# comment: (optional)
#   The flyover help for the created shortcut.  On Windows, this is what you
#   see in a yellow box when hovering over a menu item.
#
# icon: (optional)
#   A Windows-formatted .ico file.  Used on both Windows and Linux.
#
# icns: (optional)
#   An OSX .icns file, default to 'PythonInterpreter.icns' (Python rocket)
#
# id: (required)
#   A id for this shortcut.  This is used to name the shortcut files on
#   platforms where the filename is not the display name the user sees.
#
# categories: (required)
#   This is a list of categories, each of which refers to a menu for the
#   shortcut to be created within.  If empty, then the shortcut will not be
#   added to any menus (in which case, it isn't displayed unless quicklaunch
#   or desktop are set to True -- see below.)
#
# name: (required)
#   The display name of the shortcut as shown to the user.
#
# terminal: (required, boolean)
#   Whether or not the application starts a terminal (like ipython does)
#
# quicklaunch: (optional, boolean)
#   Whether or not a quicklaunch item should be created for this shortcut.
#   This does not solely determine if a quicklaunch item will be created as
#   the user must have granted permission to create quicklaunch shortcuts at
#   all during the installation of the application environment this shortcut
#   request is part of. That setting is the ADDTOLAUNCHER variable stored in 
#   custom_tools\Property.dat.  When the Property.dat file does not exist,
#   the default for ADDTOLAUNCHER is True, which means this setting controls
#   whether the quicklaunch shortcut is created or not.
#
# desktop: (optional, boolean)
#   Whether or not a desktop item should be created for this shortcut.
#   This does not solely determine if a desktop item will be created as
#   the user must have granted permission to create desktop shortcuts at
#   all during the installation of the application environment this shortcut
#   request is part of. That setting is the ADDTODESKTOP variable stored in 
#   custom_tools\Property.dat.  When the Property.dat file does not exist,
#   the default for ADDTODESKTOP is True, which means this setting controls
#   whether the desktop shortcut is created or not.
#
# Notes:
# * The location of icons files, can be specified by the absolute or
#   relative path.  Where a relative path is understood to be relative to the
#   location of this (appinst data) file.
# * The location of the executable command, i.e. the first element in the
#   value corresponding to 'cmd', is assumed to be located in sys.prefex/bin
#   (on Windows sys.prefex/Scripts, unless the string starts with '..'.
#   In the later case it is assumed to be relative to the location of this
#   (appinst data) file.

SHORTCUTS = [

# MENUS is an optional variable which specifies the menus to install the
# application into.  If not provided, then AppInst tries to create a default
# set of menus based on what it can introscpect from the install Python
# environment.   (This works best when the Python environment is the result
# of an Enicab installer.)
#
# If a definition is provided here, the declared menus can either be nested
# inside the same default menus described above, or they can form their own
# top-level menu tree(s).  See below for more information.
#
# The example below is what MENUS defaults to in a an EPD installed Python.
# This default is obtained from the of values of the Manufacturer, NAME
# (product name) and FULL_VERSION (product version) exposed in the custom_tools
# package.
#
# MENUS is a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per desired menu tree.
# Each dictionary can have the following keys:

# parent: (optional, defaults to None)
#   Where to place the menu relative to the default menus AppInst creates for
#   you.  Possible values are:
#
#   'ROOT' : Refers to the root of the menu tree structure.  When this is
#       specified, the menu will be a at the top-level of all menus.  For
#       example, on Windows it would appear immediately under
#       'Start Menu'->'Programs'
#
#   None : Makes this menu a child of the last default menu AppInst created
#       for you from introspection of the Python environment.  This is useful
#       when you want multiple sub-menus inside of your application's menu.
#       For example, in EPD this might create an 'Examples' or 'Docs' menu
#       under 'Enthought'->'EPD Py25 v4.2.30101'.
#
#   <string> : Any other value is expected to be a category corresponding to
#       an existing menu, either in the defaults AppInst created for you, or
#       in a menu you've defined earlier.   This is most useful when you want
#       to create a new menu somewhere within the tree hierarchy of AppInst's
#       default menus.  For example, to create a 'Foo' menu at
#       'Enthought'->'Foo'.
#
# category: (optional)
#   The category for this menu.  This is always appended to the parent menu's
#   category using a '.' for a separator, assuming there is a parent menu.
#   Note that parent in this context does not mean the parent keyword above,
#   it simply means the parent of this menu in a menu hierarchy.

# id: (required)
#   Specifies the id used for this menu.  On platforms where the filename is
#   not the display name, this is used as the filename.   It is also used to
#   generate a category value for this menu if none was explicitly provided.
#   That generation happens by title capitalization of this string, then
#   appending it to the parent menu's, if any, category using a '.' as a
#   separator between levels.
#
# name: (required)
#   The display name of this menu as shown to the user.
#
# sub-menus: (optional)
#   A list of dictionaries defining the next layer of a menu hierarchy.  Each
#   dictionary in the list may contain all the settings defined above, EXCEPT
#   for parent, which will be ignored on all sub-menus.
