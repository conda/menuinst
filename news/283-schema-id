### Enhancements

* Bump schema version to `1`. (#282 via #283)

### Bug fixes

* Use `$schema` to indicate which schema will validate the menuinst shortcut.
  This means that menuinst shortcuts must now include a `$schema` key pointing to a URL containing the relevant menuinst JSON schema version. (#282 via #283, #313)

### Deprecations

* `$id` key is no longer required in the schema, and is now deprecated. (#282 via #283)
